I'm Ignacio Tampe, a data scientist with a strong passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights and drive actionable results. I specialize in NLP, machine learning, big data, and time series forecasting.

With experience at top-tier companies like Microsoft and Uber, I have had the privilege of working on exciting projects that have allowed me to refine my skills and make a tangible impact. At Microsoft, I designed and developed end-to-end ML solutions for the Clarity Insights Team. Notably, I created an automatic insights digest feature that reached over 300,000 users, providing personalized recommendations and highlighting key metric changes.
